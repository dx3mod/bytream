# Bytream

A streaming bytes and crunching them library.

This library contains angostic I/O runtime mechanisms for organization byte streams processing for write and read in an efficient manner, e.g. for buildings codecs and protocol implementations.

Features
* Byte-oriented processing of I/O via slice-based abstraction inspired by the [Bytesrw] library
* Scatter/gather friendly input and output for more efficient use of subsystem resources
* Channels-like APIs make it possible to write natural OCaml code in a direct style
